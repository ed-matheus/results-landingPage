# FrontEnd Mentor Component - Results Summary
<img src="design/desktop-design.jpg">

## Hello, how's it going?

This is a website that I built as a challenge project from FrontEnd Mentor called Results Summary, a landing page.
I got the challenge on the website https://www.frontendmentor.io, that has a lot of FrontEnd challenges available!

This projet was built with basic HTML, CSS and JS, using Bootstrap for styles and Media Queries for a better responsive page, so
the website can fit all screen sizes. I used JS to get the data from the file data.json.

You can see my other projects among my repositories and other ones on desenvolvimento-web repository. Thank you!
